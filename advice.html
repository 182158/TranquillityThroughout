		<h3> At Tranquillity Throughout, we want to offer something that no other service that focuses on help does: a community. We want to give others the opportunity to build up a network and establish a community, where they can share experiences or advice in order to possibly help others. We want our communityto blossom and grow in order to help build up support for each other but our end goal is to have the user be able to become fully self reliant.</h3>

	<h3> When dealing with my depression, I often found that counting to 10 when imagining something can help me ease away from depressive episodes. For example, I count to 10 while imagining water drops falling from a leaf after a storm. It really calms me down and helps me focus.</h3>

	<h3> Take up some form of exercise. There's evidence that exercise can help lift your mood. If you haven't exercised for a while, start gently by walking for 20 minutes every day.</h3>

	<h3> One time in high school my friend spent the night, sleeping on my floor directly underneath the ceiling fan. I couldnâ€™t sleep for hours because I imagined what I would do if the ceiling fan suddenly collapsed. I went over the plan again and again, all night long. My anxiety kept me so on edge that I coudln't sleep.</h3>

	<h3> My first major episode had a big impact in my life, I lost my job, my marriage broke down, I struggled with relationships and lost any sense of who I was. At times suicide seemed the only real option. Fortunately, recovery and relearning about myself has brought its rewards and I have a good life today.</h3>
