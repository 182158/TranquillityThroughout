	<h2>The Design of our Website</h2>
		<h3> Our designs for this website was to be simple, clean, and nice to look at. Our target group is for people that suffer with mental health issues and people that could get easily overwhelmed. We wanted to create a calming feel when looking at the sight with nothing that contrasts too dramatic or that could be overly vibrant. We kept the same font throughout the website to ensure consistency but made sure there was a difference between sub-headers and paragraphs using italics. </h3>

			<h2><br>The Flow of Our Website</h2>
		<img src="images/flow.jpg" class="img-fluid " alt="flow image"></div>
	<br>
		<h3> The design of the website navigation was to ensure that it was easy to use. We opted for a drop down menu as our website turned out to have a lot of information pages, which cluttered the navbar. We ensured that the main menu dropdown menu at the top left was always visible and you could switch between pages very easily. </h3>

	<h2><br>The Wireframes</h2>
	<div class="row">

		<img src="images/wireabout.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="wireframe"></div>
		<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12">
	<br>
		<h3> Here we have the home and the about Wireframes. The home orginally had the three images, but during the design of our website: we decided to put all the information regarding mental health onto the homepage as it deemed one of the more important things to have. Then we also created an image which had our brand vision on the image. <br><br>
		
			For the about page, we moved the mission statement onto the about page as it seemed more fitting to be there. It would tell what our mission statement is and then inform about the team. 	<br><br>
			
			We also swapped from having a navbar to a dropdown menu. During our interviews for the Lean Canvas, we found that people with axniety got overwhelmed by all the information at the top. The decision was made to put all the nav options into a drop down menu. <br><br><br>

	<h4>The Visual Design</h4>
	<h5> Thisare the colours that we used for the brand development project. We kept using these images as they are (for the most part) a calm and easy to look at pallet.<br><br>
				The font chosen for this was Helvetica as it was the one that we could use, that still also closely resembled our chosen brand development fonts: Calibri and Century Gothic.</h5>

	<h2>User Testing report</h2><br>
		<h3> During our testing, GitHub pages went down for maintenence and so we had to adapt. We asked people that we lived with and shared our screen when video calling others, in order to test and ask the folllowing:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li> How easy it is to navigate the website. </li>
			<li> How the style design of the website is.</li>
			<li> If it is a professional looking website.</li>
			<li> How if the layout of website is.</li>
			<li> Recommendations</li>
			</ul><br>
		We asked 5 people and they all provided feedback on the website. They all stated that they found the website easy to naviagte and they liked that the menu button at the top left was always visible, even though 2 struggled to find it at the beginning. <br><br>
			
		They found the style design of the website to be minimalistic and nice to look at. One said that it seemed a bit too basic. The majority said it looks like an actual professional website. One stated that she found the website to be appealing to people with mental health. <br><br>
			
		Many found the website to be nicely laid out and easy to follow. However, two feel like the information regarding mental health should have been on a separate page.<br><br>
			
		One had the recommmendations to separate the sub headers and the text better, which has already been adapted. Three stated that in order to build a community, they wished to see a commenting system or for it to be a proper forum. Our main goal for the future would be to implement a commenting or forum system. Another future plan would be to see if we can make the website a bit more appealing to look at. It is still very basic and could do with some more design stylings. <br><br>
			
		After receiving feedback from our production supervisor: we opted to have a navbar at the top of the page, but put some of the selections into a drop bar, to ensure it still would not be overwhelming to some viewers.
