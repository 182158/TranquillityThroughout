	<h5>I've been using this service for a few weeks now and it's already started helping me. Having a community that understands my anxiety and can often give advice on how to deal with it is extremely valuable. It has also given me the strength to work against my anxiety and I can finally support myself when dealing with my own mental health. </h5>

	<h4> Sasha Charlston</h4>
	<h5> I have been using Tranquillity Throughout for a while now and it has really helped me deal with my depression in different ways. One of the users advised to do something I had never thought of before, counting to 10 when I can feel a bout of depression building while picturing something calming. I slowly count to 10 and imagine waves coming in, counting with each wave. It really helps calm down and I would never have thought of this without this site!</h5>

	<h4>Eric Halen</h4>
	<h5>This website has been a god send. It's helped me learn how to deal with my girlfriend, who suffers from Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Users that share their advice and experiences not only help people that suffer from mental health issues, but also let people who don't suffer from them understand them better.  </h5>
